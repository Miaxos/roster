/// The CLIENT SETNAME command assigns a name to the current connection.

/// The assigned name is displayed in the output of CLIENT LIST so that it is
/// possible to identify the client that performed a given connection.
///
/// For instance when Redis is used in order to implement a queue, producers and
/// consumers of messages may want to set the name of the connection according
/// to their role.
///
/// There is no limit to the length of the name that can be assigned if not the
/// usual limits of the Redis string type (512 MB). However it is not possible
/// to use spaces in the connection name as this would violate the format of the
/// CLIENT LIST reply.
///
/// It is possible to entirely remove the connection name setting it to the
/// empty string, that is not a valid connection name since it serves to this
/// specific purpose.
///
/// The connection name can be inspected using CLIENT GETNAME.
///
/// Every new connection starts without an assigned name.
///
/// Tip: setting names to connections is a good way to debug connection leaks
/// due to bugs in the application using Redis.
